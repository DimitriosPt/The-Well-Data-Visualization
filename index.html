  <h2>Dataset</h2>

  <p>
    The Dataset I've explored is a collection of attendance records from CSUS's very own gym, The Well.
    The Well first opened in 2010 and has since been a popular addition to the campus.
    <br />
    <br />The dataset highlights a variety of important attendance information. Data is seperated
    by gender, days of the week, and the grand totals for entire years. I have additionally
    added data to observe trends against weather and to model attendance against the school population.
    The majority of the data I used was provided to me by The Well.
    <br />
    As an avid user of The Well facility, my primary goal in exploring this dataset was finding ways to
    optimize my workouts- primarily by finding when the gym was the least populated. This drove me to explore
    a variety of avenues such as weather and day of the week to determine when the best time for me to go to
    the gym was to avoid waiting on other people.
  </p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Initial Analysis Questions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>When is the gym the least busy? (Time, Day, Month)?</li>
    <li>How does weather affect gym attendance?</li>
    <li>Does gender play a factor in retention rate (continued attendance)?</li>
  </ol>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Discoveries &amp; Insights</h2>

  <p>
    The first topic to explore is population trends. Put simply, when are
    the most people in the gym? I wanted to start small with an hourly break down
    then progressively expand outward to day of the week, then week of the year,
    and lastly month and season.
  </p>

            Hottest Times To Go To The Gym
        </p>
      <p>
        Many people try to fit going to the gym into their already packed schedules. Since people
        are so busy it is important to find the times where you are mostly likely to be
        uninterrupted while completing your workout.
        When I had first envisioned exploring this question I was hoping The Well
        would also have timestamps for when people left so I could map overall population
        in the gym at any given time, but that data is not recorded unfortunately. The most interesting thing
        about the trends shown here is that it is bimodal whereas I expected a mostly
        normal distribution around 1:30 or so.

      </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Now that I knew the best times to go, what about the day of the week?
      Shown as a pie chart depicting the sums of check ins by day across almost 4 years.
      I was originally expecting Monday - Thursday to be the same with Friday through Sunday being
      minuscule by comparison. That is roughly what we see here but I was surprised to see that Tuesday
      was the busiest day of the week.
    </p>

    </p>

    <p>
      What is shown here is actually just  a small snippet of the original chart.
      In the original there is an entry for every day of the year. It is extremely verbose
      but I wanted to provide a way for the Marketing Team at The Well observe
      trends for any day they wanted.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      While this chart is quite the visual spectacle, it is not really all that useful.
      The chart maps how busy each day of the year was across 2018 by color and size but
      I believe even a simple line graph of attendance would impart an easier understanding
      of the information here.
    </p>

        <p class="caption">
            A summary of attendance by season (Summer omitted)
        </p>
        <p>
          With this next chart I wanted to explore how attendance of The Well has changed
          over the years since it's opening as well as answering the question of which
          semester is busier. My initial guess was that attendance would be a continuous
          upward trend and that the spring attendance would be higher as that semester occurs
          right after new years resolutions are made.
          <br/>
          <br />
          What we actually see is that the more popular season seems to shift almost
          biyearly. Equally surprising was the sharp downward trends in recent years despite
          an ever increasing student population. I'm very curious to see what caused the Spring
          of 2016 to be so popular.
        </p>

        <p class="caption">
            Effects of Weather and Temperature On Well Attendance
        </p>
      <p>
        With this chart I was hoping to determine if there was a relationship
        between specific weather conditions and gym attendance. I wrote a simple
        python script to gather weather data for each of the days listed in my data
        set. Although I had a variety of weather data at my disposal, I wanted to know
        specifically how temperature and precipitation chance affected attendance. My hypothesis
        is that the gym would be less busy on rainy days, and busier when it is hot out since the gym is
        heavily air conditioned.
        <br />
        <br />It turns out that there is almost no correlation with precipitation. Additonally
        I believe that any apparent correlaton with temperature is more due to people dropping
        off of their fitness habits as the semester goes on than it is any specific weather conditions.
      </p>

    <p class="caption">
    Seasonal Depictions of Attendance (2017 - 2018)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we have seen that temperature and rainy weather does not
      deter gym-goers, we can hypothesize that the two semesters should have
      roughly similar attendance relative to enrollment. It's important to
      map attendance as a ratio of enrollment during that semester as the fall
      semester has a consistently higher headcount than spring. Simply seeing who
      had more attendance then would be misleading. Additionally I wanted to see how
      the campus closure due to the Camp Fire in 2018 affected attendance.

      <br />
      <br /> Overall we see that the two semesters are actually very similar.
      Both seem to start with extremely high attendance levels and experience
      a sharp fall off of attendance near finals. The Camp Fire, which led
      to a complete closure of both The Well and the CSUS campus had a profound impact
      on attendance which was, of course 0, when the campus was raging.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h2 style="color: darkgoldenrod">
    Attendance and Gender
  </h2>
  <p>
    When exploring questions to ask of the data, I decided to reach out to some of my colleagues
    to see what information would impact their desire to go to the gym. One of the most common questions
    were in some way related to what kinds of people were at the gym at different times. I did not have
    access to attendance by age or by major, but I did have access to gender based statistics.
  </p>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="MonthlyGender.png" />
    <p class="caption">
    Total Attendance by Gender (2018)
    </p>
    <p>
      This first chart was an initial exploration to the question: Which gender is in the gym more at any given time?
      While it clearly shows that gym attendance is largely male (almost two thirds), it makes
      determining exactly how many men and women were actually using the gym in a given month rather difficult
      at a glance.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="MonthlyGenderPie.png" />
    <p class="caption">
    Monthly Attendance As A Ratio Of Gender (2018)
    </p>
    <p>
      This next chart was an evolution on the first and I feel provides a much more accessible
      vision of the ratios of men to women over time. My initial vision of the chart was a 2x6 array
      but Tableau consistently thwarted my efforts to display the data as such.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="entry">
    <img src="Divergant.png" />
    <p class="caption">
    A depiction of Gender Attendance By Month (2017 vs 2018)
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, given how much attendance was shown to vary between any two given years
      I wanted to map what we had learned from the previous two charts over two years.
      I again chose 2017 and 2018 as they are the most recent complete years. I greatly
      enjoyed seeing how relatively consistent attendance is between the two years
      (Female attendance in April only differed by 198 between 2017 and 2018!).
    </p>

  <div class="entry">
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
    Exploring the attendance data from The Well was extremely rewarding. Each new trend and observation
      I made can now help me schedule my days more efficiently. From my research I can now
      easily deduce the best times to attend and I learned not to expect an empty gym on rainy days.
      Perhaps most importantly I learned that the gym doesn't really "clear out after the
      first few weeks" as my fellow gym-goers so often like to say on a busy day. Additionally all of my visualizations
      will be passed along to the marketing team at The Well and will hopefully help them
      schedule activities more dynamically. Ultimately I found the decision to choose a data
      set from a facility I personally use to be quite the boon as it helped fuel my curiosity and creativity.
